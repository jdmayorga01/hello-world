# hello-world
Hey, I am trying to complete a Coursea course in Data Science. I hope to see this message in a few years and be good at programing. I have some experience in R and STATA, but I want to learn every programming language (If I can). This is my first repository, enjoy!

I am former economics student at Universidad del Rosario in Colombia. 2020 changed my planes so I stated some additional courses of programming because I have always been in love with it and it is my opportunity to get better at it
